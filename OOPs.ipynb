        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for a group of objects that share similar properties and behaviors. Classes are used to organize data and make it reusable.\n",
        "   - Examples of classes\n",
        "     - Car: A class that has properties like speed limit, mileage, and\n",
        "       number of wheels\n",
        "     - Dog: A class that has properties like name, breed, and age\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - An object is an instance of a class, created by calling the class like a function. The object contains the data and behavior defined by the class, as well as a unique identity.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - Abstraction focuses on what an object does, while encapsulation focuses on how it does it. Both are techniques that help programmers organize code.\n",
        "   - Abstraction hides implementation details, but encapsulation controls access to data and methods.\n",
        "   - Abstraction is Design-level process, but encapsulation is implementation level.\n",
        "   - Abstraction promotes code reusability, butencapsulation enhances code modularity.\n",
        "   - Example of Abstraction: A car's steering wheel and pedals abstract the driving mechanisms\n",
        "   Example of Encapsulation: A car's engine's internal components are encapsulated.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that have double underscores (__) at the beginning and end of their names. They are used to customize the behavior of objects and classes.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "   - In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is the process of deriving new classes from existing ones. It's a fundamental concept that helps make code more efficient and modular.\n",
        "   - How inheritance works:\n",
        "     - A new class, called a subclass or child class, inherits properties and methods from an existing class, called a superclass or parent class.\n",
        "     - The subclass can add new features or override existing ones.\n",
        "     - This creates a hierarchy of classes, where the subclass is related to the superclass.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, meaning a single variable or function name can be used to reference different types of objects depending on the context, allowing for code reusability and flexibility by performing different actions based on the object's actual type at runtime; essentially, it's the concept of \"one interface, multiple implementations.\".\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - Encapsulation in Python is achieved through access modifiers, naming conventions, and programming practices.\n",
        "     - Access modifiers\n",
        "       - Public\n",
        "         - The default access modifier for class members, which means they can be accessed from inside or outside of a class\n",
        "       - Private\n",
        "         - Accessible only within a class, and denoted by a double underscore prefix before their name\n",
        "       - Protected\n",
        "         - Accessible within a class and their subclasses, and denoted by a single underscore prefix before the name\n",
        "     - Naming conventions\n",
        "       - Using a double underscore in front of a variable or function name hides them when accessing them from outside of the class\n",
        "     - Programming practices\n",
        "       - Python's approach to encapsulation is more open than other languages, such as C++ or Java, which use keywords like public, private, or protected.\n",
        "       - Python's fundamental principle is “We are all adults here”.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, a constructor is a special method that is called automatically when an object is created from a class. Its main role is to initialize the object by setting up its attributes or state.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "    - A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can't access or modify it. In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "    - When two or more methods share the same name but differ in the number or type of parameters, or both, they are referred to as overloaded methods, and this concept is known as method overloading.\n",
        "    - Unlike other programming languages like Java, C++, and C#, Python does not support the feature of method overloading by default. However, there are alternative ways to achieve it.\n",
        "    - Example:\n",

        "      - Whatever the Parent has by default available to the Child through inheritance, if the Child is not satisfied with Parent class method implementation then Child is allow to redefine that Parent class method in Child class in its own way this process is called overriding.\n",
        "      - Method overriding refers to when a piece of code contains two or more methods with the same name, but each one performs a different task. Taking the literal sense of the name, this means that one approach must take precedence over another. This idea refers to redefining a base class method with the same method signature in a derived class.\n",

        "      -  We can build the programs from standard working modules that communicate with one another, rather than having to start writing the code from scratch which leads to saving of development time and higher productivity,\n",
        "      - OOP language allows to break the program into the bit-sized problems that can be solved easily (one object at a time).\n",
        "      - The new technology promises greater programmer productivity, better quality of software and lesser maintenance cost.\n",
        "      - OOP systems can be easily upgraded from small to large systems.\n",
        "      - It is possible that multiple instances of objects co-exist without any interference,\n",
        "      - It is very easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.\n",
        "      - It is possible to map the objects in problem domain to those in the program.\n",
        "      - The principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs which cannot be invaded by the code in other parts of the program.\n",
        "      - By using inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code and extend the use of existing classes.\n",
        "      - Message passing techniques is used for communication between objects which makes the interface descriptions with external systems much simpler.\n",

        " 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "     - Class variables are a special type of class attribute, also known as class properties, fields, or data members. They are shared across all instances of a class, regardless of how many instances exist. But, Instance variables are non-static variables that are created when an object of the class is instantiated. They are destroyed when the object is destroyed.\n",
        "     - Class variables are defined within the class but outside of any class methods. Instance variables are defined within class methods, typically the constructor.\n",
        "     - Changes made to the class variable affect all instances. Changes made to the instance variable does not affect all instances.\n",
        " 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "     - Multiple inheritances are when a child's class is derived from two or more parent classes. For example, you are inheriting some of the features from your father and some from your mother. In this case, we have to write the names of both parent classes inside the brackets of the child class.\n",

        "     - The @classmethod decorator is a built-in function decorator that is an expression that gets evaluated after your function is defined. The result of that evaluation shadows your function definition. A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance. A @staticmethod does not receive an implicit first argument. A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. This method can’t access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.\n",
        "     - A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.\n",
        "     - A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can’t access or modify it.\n",
